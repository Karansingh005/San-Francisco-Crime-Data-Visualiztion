# San-Francisco-Crime-Data-Visualiztion
In this project, we would be exploring the crime data of the city of San Francisco. We would be using a data set from police department of the city. In the end we would be visualizing the crime data on a map of San Francisco using Folium library and plotting the data on a Choropelth map.
There are total of three files apart from README.md in this project:
1. The Notebook.ipynb is the main file where all the codes and visualiztions are present.
2. Police_Department_Incidents_-_Previous_Year__2016_.csv is the CSV file consisting of all the crime data which helps in creating dataset for the visualiztion of crime data.
3. san-francisco.geojson helps in plotting of data since it contains the names of all the streets of San Francisco.
