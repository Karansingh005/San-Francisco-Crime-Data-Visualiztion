# San-Francisco-Crime-Data-Visualiztion
In this project, we would be exploring the crime data of the city of San Francisco. We would be using a data set from police department of the city. In the end we would be visualizing the crime data on a map of San Francisco using Folium library and plotting the data on a Choropelth map.
